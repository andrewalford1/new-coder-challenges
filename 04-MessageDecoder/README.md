# Message Decoder

A Chiper is an algorithim for performing encryption or decryption.

A caesar chipher does this by shift each character in a message by a given amount. or in other words Fn = Fn+x where x = the magnitude. For example, with a magnitude of 4:

- 'a' becomes 'e'
- 'b' becomes 'f'
- 'c' becomes 'g'
- and so on...

The following message has been encoded using a caesar cipher implement `CaesarCipher.cs` to decode it. Then, prove this works end to end by re-encoding it.
